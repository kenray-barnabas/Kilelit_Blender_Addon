Kilelit Blender Add-on. 

Kilel means Picture in my native tongue, Pohnapeian. Pronounced "gil-el". The "it" is added English. Ki for short.

Ki is a rendering tool that helps automate the rendering workflow while also offering some strong features for ease of work. 
The add-on also includes all the rendering features available in one area for easy access. In the thought of helping artist speed up their workflow. 

The first panel of this add-on is where alot of the automation is happening, and also Ki's biggest solutions. 
From Render History, History navigation, render complete sound notification, and rendering selected only.
The rest of the add-on are focused to place things in one area, which comes in handy when working in the viewport alone. 

To install the Ki, simply go to the preferences in Blender, add-ons, and install from disk the zip file.

I hope you guys find this tool useful! Happy Blendering!
